Title: Creating Your First AI Artwork

**Using DALL-E or DeepArt:**
1. Choose Your Tool: Decide whether you want to try DALL-E or DeepArt.
2. Write a Prompt: Write a sentence describing the image you want. Be as descriptive as possible!
   - Example: "A cat wearing a wizard hat casting spells in a library."
3. Experiment with Style: If you're using DeepArt, choose a style (e.g., Van Gogh, Picasso).

**Task:**
Try creating your first piece of digital artwork using your chosen tool.

**Feedback Prompt:**
Once youâ€™ve created your image, share your experience. What did you find surprising or interesting?

### Step 3: Experimenting with Prompts

**Refining Your Prompts:**
- Be Specific: The more details you provide, the more the AI can capture your vision.
- Experiment: Try changing words to see how it affects the image.

**Example:**
- Vague: "A mountain"
- Detailed: "A snow-capped mountain under a starry night sky with a glowing moon."

**Task:**
Create another image using a new prompt. Compare it with your first one.

**Comprehension Check:**
How does changing the details of your prompt change the image the AI generates?
