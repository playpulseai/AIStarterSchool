    ery page. Make it fully functional, not demo-mode or placeholder-based.

🔧 TASK: Finalize the /gallery route for real student use

1. Connect Gallery to Firebase using authenticated user ID:

    Read data from:
    firebase.firestore().collection('student_projects').doc(userId).collection('projects')

    Each project should have:

        title

        type (e.g., "AI Art", "Fantasy Writing", "Prompt Response")

        timestamp

        thumbnail or short preview

        content

    If login is active, use auth.currentUser.uid

    If in demo mode, show message: “No saved projects in demo mode.”

2. Display student projects by type:

    Group projects into sections:

        🎨 AI Art Creation

        ✍️ Fantasy World Generator

        📝 AI Writing Projects

        📚 Completed Lessons

    For each card, show:

        Title

        Date created

        Short preview (image or text snippet)

        Type icon

        Action buttons: View / Delete

3. Empty State:

    If no projects exist, show this message:

        “No projects yet. Complete a lesson or explore the AI Playground to get started!”

    Add optional CTA button: “Go to Playground” or “Start a Lesson”

4. Remove All Placeholders:

    No fake data

    No “Sample Project” or lorem ipsum

    All content should be 100% user-driven via Firebase

5. Auto-refresh on login or after saving a project:

    After a project is saved (from lesson or sandbox), it should appear in the gallery on page reload

    If login changes, reload the Firebase query using new userId

🔐 Security/Access:

    Only show a student's own projects

    Do not allow access to other users' galleries

    If user is not logged in and not in demo mode, redirect to login or block access

✅ When complete, test this flow:

    Run a lesson or sandbox (e.g., Art Creator)

    Save a project

    Open /gallery

    See correct user’s saved content grouped by type

    Delete one and confirm it updates
