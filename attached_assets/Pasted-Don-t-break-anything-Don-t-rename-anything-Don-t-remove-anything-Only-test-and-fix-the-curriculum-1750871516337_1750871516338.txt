Don’t break anything. Don’t rename anything. Don’t remove anything. Only test and fix the curriculum system as defined below. Update the changelog when done.

You must confirm that each feature below is FUNCTIONAL, not just implemented. Only confirm with ✅ if tested and fully working as described. If anything is not functional, fix it and confirm the fix.

🧠 CURRICULUM CORE FUNCTIONALITY QA CHECKLIST:

1. ✅ Is the "Start Learning" button working for all subjects and loading the correct curriculum modules?

2. ✅ Are lesson plans generated based on grade and subject, not just showing the same placeholder chat?

3. ✅ Is the AI giving personalized greetings like:  
   “Welcome back! Last time you studied [Topic]”  
   If not, fix the memory retrieval logic from Firebase.

4. ✅ Is the AI memory system logging:  
   • Last lesson topic  
   • Missed test concepts  
   • Preferred learning style  
   • Session history to `/session_logs/userId/timestamp` in Firebase?

5. ✅ Is the lesson plan structured into clear steps, not just one long message? (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, etc.)

6. ✅ Is the system using voice input and/or speech output in the curriculum agent chat?  
   If not, confirm what’s missing (mic input hook, speech synthesis, etc.)

7. ✅ When students type vague prompts like "red", does the AI respond with improvement suggestions (e.g. “Too vague. Try adding more details.”)? Is that system working correctly?

8. ✅ Are quizzes or comprehension checks part of the lesson flow?  
   If not, make sure curriculum supports at least 1 quiz interaction per session.

9. ✅ Are the “Lesson Complete” checkpoints recorded to the student profile?

10. ✅ Is the AI dynamically adapting future lessons based on what the student got wrong or skipped?

When you finish, confirm with ✅ next to each item above. If any item is missing, fix it and explain how you resolved it in the changelog.

This is a **mission-critical QA test** — curriculum is our core product. Don’t skip any steps. Only confirm if truly working, not just present.
